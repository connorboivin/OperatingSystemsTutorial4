 Jeopardy game

This program simulates the game of Jeopardy. It uses a command line prompt for user interaction. It first asks for the four player names which will be recorded and their initial earnings set to 0.
The program then prints out each of the question categories and displays the dollar values for each question.
The program will accept the name of the person selected to pick a question and validates that the name matches to one of the prerecorded player names.
The program then prompts the player for the category and dollar amount question and check if it's not already answered.
